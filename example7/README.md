# GSoC 2018 MNE


### How to example 7:
replace the files in the MNE root directory, with the files in example6. The dependencies are as if example6 was MNE's root directory.

Afterwards navigate to the mne folder via terminal and execute:

python setup.py install

or

sudo -H python setup.py install

Then you should be able to use the newly introduced **SourceMorph** class and view all the nice tutorials :)
